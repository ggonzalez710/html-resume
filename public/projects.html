<h1>Here's a list of my best projects!</h1>
<ul>
    <li><h2>Visual Basic Programming: Calculator</h2>
        <p>A computer application with a graphical user interface that's a calculator capable of making basic 
            mathematical calculations.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h2>Python Game Development: Pac-Man</h2>
        <p>I programmed the classic arcade game "Pac-Man" from scratch with graphics.py, an object-oriented graphics library.
            For my version of the game I created my own movement algorithm so that the ghosts that chase Pac-Man move randomly
            across the map. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h2>Python Game Development: Solitaire</h2>
        <p>This was a group project that consisted of programming the game Solitaire with only one library (graphics.py).
            It was designed to be virtually impossible to complete due to the graphics.py library's limitations, yet my group
            reached a 90% completion state, the highest of the class.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h2>Visual Basic Programming: Resistor Calculator</h2>
        <p>Programmed a computer application with a graphical user interface that accepts the ohm value of a resistor as input
            and then displays the resistor's appropriate color code; the program also allows the user to choose the resistor's
            color bands to then use that color code to calculate the resistance in ohms.
        </p>
